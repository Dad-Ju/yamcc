Yet another Minecraft Cloud

# Why ?

I've locked around on the internet and there is a masive size of clouds out yet... but i dont like em. All clouds are more like a cli or not fully working if there is a gui.
So i thought about making one by myself :)

It wont be simple but it will be fun :D

# Why Open Source ?

Its simple. I don't care about my code. I write it down and test stuff if its working its here, if not you can do it for me :D
